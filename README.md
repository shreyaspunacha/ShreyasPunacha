I am a Postdoctoral fellow in the University of Washington, Seattle. My research focuses
on the intricate relationship between the cortical and biomechanical changes during the oromotor behaviour 
and their implications in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease and other age-related dementias.

In our laboratory, we use chronically implanted microelectrode arrays to capture the cortical activity in the orofacial sensorimotor cortex while simultaneously tracking the precise movements of the tongue and the jaw in three dimensions using a biplanar video-radiography setup. These observations are made during the natural feeding behaviour of both the young and old macaques, providing valuable insights into the complex mechanisms at play.

My academic background is rooted in Physics, with a specialization in computational biology. I hold a PhD from the Physics department at National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal in India. My doctral research was focused on the dynamics and control of spiral waves that cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias using low voltage electric fields. I have also explored pattern formation in Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction and tackled computational problems in Blackhole Thermodynamics and Fluid Gravity.

I am a Postdoctoral fellow in the University of Washington, Seattle. My research focuses
on how cortical and biomechanical changes in the oromotor behaviour contribute to the onset and
progression of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other age-related dementias. In our laboratory, we simultaneously 
record cortical activity from multiple chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in the Orofacial Sensorimotor 
cortex with 3D tracking of tongue and jaw kinematics using biplanar video radiography setup while young and old macaques 
engage in natural feeding behaviour.

I am primarily from Physics background with a specialisation in computational biology. I have a PhD from the Physics department,
National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India. My doctoral thesis was focoused on the
dynamics and control of cardiac-arrhytimia-causing spiral waves using low voltage electric fields. I have also worked the 
pattern formation in Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction and computational problems on Blackhole Thermodynamics.
